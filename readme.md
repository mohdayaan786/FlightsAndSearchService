# ‚úàÔ∏è Welcome to Flights Service

This project provides a backend service for managing flights, including airplanes, airports, cities, and flight details.

## üöÄ Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the root directory:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variable:
```
PORT=3000
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Database
1. Inside the `src/config` folder, create a new file called `config.json`.
2. Add the following JSON configuration:
```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "<Your DB Password>",
    "database": "Flights_Search_DB-DEV",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Database
Once the database configuration is set up, navigate to the `src` folder and run:
```sh
npx sequelize db:create
```

## üõ§Ô∏è API Routes

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The project follows a relational database model with the following tables:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ City Table**
| Column    | Type         | Constraints    |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| id        | int         | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| name      | varchar(255)| Unique, Not Null |
| createdAt | datetime    | Not Null       |
| updatedAt | datetime    | Not Null       |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Airport Table**
| Column    | Type         | Constraints    |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| id        | int         | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| name      | varchar(255)| Not Null      |
| address   | varchar(255)| Nullable      |
| city_id   | int         | Foreign Key (City) |
| createdAt | datetime    | Not Null       |
| updatedAt | datetime    | Not Null       |

**Relationships:**
- A **city** has many airports.
- An **airport** belongs to a single city (One-to-Many relationship).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Airplane Table**
| Column        | Type         | Constraints    |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| id           | int         | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| modelNumber  | varchar(255)| Not Null      |
| capacity     | int         | Default: 200  |
| createdAt    | datetime    | Not Null      |
| updatedAt    | datetime    | Not Null      |

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Flight Table**
| Column            | Type         | Constraints    |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| id               | int         | Primary Key, Auto Increment |
| flightNumber     | varchar(255)| Unique, Not Null |
| airplaneId       | int         | Foreign Key (Airplane) |
| departureAirportId | int       | Foreign Key (Airport) |
| arrivalAirportId  | int       | Foreign Key (Airport) |
| arrivalTime      | datetime    | Not Null      |
| departureTime    | datetime    | Not Null      |
| price           | float       | Not Null      |
| boardingGate     | varchar(255)| Nullable      |
| totalSeats       | int         | Not Null      |
| createdAt        | datetime    | Not Null      |
| updatedAt        | datetime    | Not Null      |

**Relationships:**
- A **flight** belongs to an **airplane**, but one airplane can be used in multiple flights.
- A **flight** has a departure and arrival airport, both linked to the **Airport** table.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
- Run database migrations: `npx sequelize db:migrate`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- Use API routes to manage flights and airport services.

### üìå Notes
- Make sure you have MySQL installed and running before setting up the database.
- Keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control.
- Follow proper naming conventions when defining environment variables (`PORT` instead of `Port`).
